# Contributing to XSS Payload Research Hub

Thanks for your interest! This repo is my personal portfolio project for red team aspirations, but community input makes it stronger. Contributions must be ethical, unique, and educational.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork & Clone**: Star first! Fork the repo and clone locally.
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-payload`).
3. **Add Payloads**: 
   - Edit relevant .txt files.
   - Include: Payload, brief explanation, bounty context (anonymized), and why it's unique.
   - Example: "Bypassed Akamai WAF in e-com site by using full-width Unicode in event handler."
   - No duplicates or copy-pastes – make it original!
4. **Test**: Validate in a safe lab (e.g., DVWA, PortSwigger).
5. **Commit**: Clear messages, e.g., "Add Unicode evasion for WAFs with hunter's note."
6. **Pull Request**: Submit with title like "New Polyglot for SPA Targets" and describe impact.
7. **Guidelines**:
   - Ethical only: No malicious links or live exploits.
   - Unique: Add "Bounty Hunter's Twist" variants.
   - Educational: Include chaining ideas.
   - No stars farming – genuine value!
